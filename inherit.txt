Two purposes of inheritance is that one it allows you to reuse code. So instead of making an entirly new class that is similar to another class, you can create a base class that holds the code in common and create 2 child classes that inheriti from it and build on new features. 
Another purpose is that inheritance allows for polymorpism which is an important concept in CS where one object can be of different forms which allows for a consistant interface to interface with the object.
