increment_int_b is a pass by reference function and thus modifies the argument passed into the function call. This is because dictionaries are pass by reference. On the flip side, increment_int_a is a pass by value function so the value is passed in instead of the address of the function so the value passed in is not modified as the stack Frame closes with the updated value so the outside world never sees it.
